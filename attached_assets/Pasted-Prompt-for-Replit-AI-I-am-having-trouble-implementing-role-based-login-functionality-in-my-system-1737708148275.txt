"I am having trouble implementing role-based login functionality in my system. I need two separate login paths: one for investors (clients) and one for administrators. Here's how the system should work:

1. Login Roles
Investor Login:

Investors log in to access the client interface, where they can:
Browse available real estate and business investment opportunities.
View detailed information about each investment.
Make investments in available opportunities.
Track their portfolio and earnings.
Administrator Login:

Administrators log in to access a completely separate admin interface, where they can:
Add new investment opportunities (real estate or businesses).
Edit existing opportunities (update descriptions, upload new photos, or modify financial information).
Delete or deactivate investment cards that are no longer relevant.
Manage system-wide settings related to investments.
2. Key Differences Between Interfaces
Investor Interface:

Focus on viewing, exploring, and managing personal investments.
No options for adding, editing, or deleting investment cards.
Include features like filters, sorting, and detailed investment views.
Administrator Interface:

Focus entirely on investment management:
Add/Edit/Delete investment opportunities.
Upload photos, documents, and files for investment cards.
Manage categories or classifications (e.g., Core Plus, Value-Add).
Administrators should not see or interact with the investment actions (e.g., "Invest Now").
3. Technical Requirements
Role-Based Authentication:

During login, determine the user’s role (investor or admin) based on the credentials.
Redirect users to the appropriate interface based on their role:
Investors → Investor Dashboard.
Administrators → Admin Dashboard.
Role-Specific Routes:

Separate routes for each role:
/investor for investor features.
/admin for admin features.
Ensure that unauthorized users cannot access the admin interface by directly navigating to /admin.
Database/User Management:

Include a role field in the user database:
Example: { username: "admin", password: "hashed_password", role: "admin" }.
Use this field to determine which interface the user should see after login.
Backend Logic:

Create two distinct sets of APIs:
Investor APIs: Fetch available investments, track portfolio, manage investments.
Admin APIs: Add, edit, delete, and manage investment data.
Frontend Implementation:

Build separate UI components for investors and administrators:
Investor components should focus on exploring and investing.
Admin components should include forms and tools for managing investment cards.
4. Fixing the Current Problem
Currently, both investors and administrators see the same interface, which is incorrect. Please implement the following steps to fix this:

Ensure the admin role is properly identified during login.
Redirect administrators to a completely separate admin interface.
Restrict admin-specific features (e.g., "Add Investment") to the admin interface only.
Prevent investors from accessing admin routes or tools, even if they attempt to navigate there manually.
5. Deliverables
Fully functioning login system that correctly redirects users based on their role.
Separate and distinct interfaces for investors and administrators.
Role-based access control to ensure secure separation of functionality.
Clear documentation of how the roles are implemented and managed.
Please carefully implement these changes, ensuring that investors and administrators have completely separate interfaces and functionalities."
