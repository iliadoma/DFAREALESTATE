"I want to update the existing investment platform to clearly separate investments in real estate and lifestyle businesses. Currently, these investments are mixed together, which makes it difficult for users to distinguish between the two. Here's what I need:

1. Clear Separation of Investments
Dashboard Update:

Divide the investment dashboard into two distinct sections:
Real Estate Investments: Show investments in commercial spaces, such as ground-floor retail properties, standalone buildings, or office spaces.
Lifestyle Business Investments: Show investments in businesses operating within those properties, such as restaurants, yoga studios, fitness centers, and cafes.
Tabs or Categories:

Add tabs or a toggle at the top of the dashboard, allowing users to switch between:
"Real Estate Investments"
"Lifestyle Business Investments"
Alternatively, use a side-by-side view where both categories are displayed in separate columns.
Summary View:

Display a summary section for each category, showing:
Total investments (e.g., "Youâ€™ve invested in 5 properties and 3 businesses").
Monthly income generated by each category.
ROI statistics for real estate vs. businesses.
2. Investment Details
Real Estate Investments:

Show key property details:
Property type (e.g., retail, office, ground floor).
Location.
Rental income and occupancy rates.
Use visual icons for properties (e.g., buildings, storefronts).
Lifestyle Business Investments:

Display business-specific details:
Type of business (e.g., restaurant, yoga studio).
Revenue share or profit participation.
Business health metrics (e.g., customer traffic, monthly sales).
Use animated or category-specific icons (e.g., cafe cups, fitness equipment).
3. User Experience Enhancements
Filters and Sorting:

Add filters for each category to further refine results:
Real Estate: Filter by location, property type, or ROI.
Businesses: Filter by industry (e.g., fitness, retail, dining) or expected profit.
Include sorting options such as "Highest ROI," "Newest Investment," or "Most Popular."
Visual Design:

Use distinct colors or styles to differentiate the two categories:
Example: Blue for real estate and green for lifestyle businesses.
Add icons or images to make it visually intuitive for users to identify categories.
4. Technical Implementation
Frontend:

Update the current dashboard UI in React.js (or the existing framework) to:
Separate investments into two categories visually.
Add tabs, toggles, or columns for easy navigation.
Use dynamic components to load investments for each category.
Backend:

Modify the API to categorize and fetch investments as:
Real Estate Investments.
Lifestyle Business Investments.
Ensure database tables or fields can distinguish between the two categories.
Data Structure:

Update the data model to include a category field (e.g., category: real_estate or category: business).
Ensure new investments are tagged with the appropriate category during creation.
5. Deliverables
Updated dashboard with:
Clear separation of real estate and lifestyle business investments.
Tabs, toggles, or side-by-side views for easy navigation.
Filters and sorting options for each category.
API updates to support category-based data fetching.
Visual styling to differentiate between categories.
6. Future Scalability
New Categories:
Design the system to easily add more categories in the future (e.g., "Industrial Investments," "Technology Businesses").
Category-Specific Insights:
Provide tailored analytics and insights for each category, such as market trends or performance benchmarks.
Please implement these changes to ensure users can easily distinguish between real estate and lifestyle business investments while maintaining a seamless and engaging user experience."
