"I want to categorize real estate and business investments in my platform to provide users with clear classifications based on their risk, return, and characteristics. Here are the categories and their details:

1. Real Estate Categories
New Conservative Real Estate (Новая консервативная недвижимость):

Description: Properties purchased at the early development stage (e.g., zero cycle) that grow in value over time while providing stable income.
Characteristics:
High potential for price appreciation.
Moderate rental income during holding.
Examples: Residential or commercial properties in developing areas.
Core Plus Real Estate in Unique Locations (Core Plus недвижимость):

Description: Premium properties in iconic or high-demand locations with conservative but stable income.
Characteristics:
High purchase cost.
Moderate and predictable returns.
Long-term value ("eternal" assets).
Examples: Properties in central business districts or luxury neighborhoods.
Unique Value-Add Real Estate (Уникальная недвижимость с добавленной стоимостью):

Description: Properties requiring improvement or redevelopment to significantly increase their value and generate income.
Characteristics:
Higher risk but higher reward upon successful redevelopment.
Examples: Historical buildings, underutilized commercial spaces, or distressed assets.
2. Business Investment Categories
Systematic Businesses (Системные бизнесы):
