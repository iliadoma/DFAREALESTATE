"I want to optimize my platform's pages for different screen sizes. Currently, the pages are not responsive and do not adjust properly when the browser window is resized or when viewed on different devices. Here’s what I need:

1. Responsive Design
Flexible Layouts:

Update all pages to use responsive layout techniques:
Use CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid for dynamic content arrangement.
Ensure content adjusts fluidly to fit various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Breakpoints:

Implement breakpoints for key screen sizes using media queries:
Mobile: ≤480px.
Tablet: 481px–768px.
Desktop: ≥769px.
Ensure elements resize, stack, or reorganize appropriately at each breakpoint.
Typography and Images:

Adjust font sizes and line heights for readability on smaller screens.
Ensure images and videos scale proportionally without distorting or overflowing.
2. Navigation Adjustments
Responsive Menus:

Replace fixed navigation bars with a hamburger menu or collapsible sidebar for smaller screens.
Ensure navigation menus are touch-friendly for mobile devices.
Interactive Elements:

Increase button sizes and spacing to make them easy to tap on mobile screens.
Ensure hover effects are replaced with touch-friendly alternatives for mobile.
3. Testing Across Devices
Cross-Device Compatibility:

Test all pages on common devices and resolutions (e.g., iPhone, Android phones, tablets, laptops, 4K monitors).
Use browser developer tools or tools like BrowserStack to simulate various screen sizes and resolutions.
Performance Optimization:

Ensure fast load times on mobile by optimizing assets:
Compress images and videos.
Use responsive image techniques (e.g., srcset for different resolutions).
4. Technical Implementation
CSS Framework:

Use a responsive CSS framework like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or write custom CSS with media queries.
Viewport Meta Tag:

Add the following <meta> tag to all pages for proper scaling on mobile devices:
html
Копировать
Редактировать
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Dynamic Content Adjustments:

Ensure tables, charts, and other dynamic elements adapt to smaller screens by enabling horizontal scrolling or collapsing columns.
5. Deliverables
Fully responsive pages optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
A consistent user experience across different screen sizes.
Updated navigation and layout elements for better usability on mobile.
Testing and debugging to ensure flawless performance on all devices.
Please generate the necessary code and adjustments to make all pages responsive and optimized for changing screen sizes."
